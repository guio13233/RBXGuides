10. The game should hang. DO NOT SPAM RUN.
11. Go back into x32dbg, go to the CPU tab, and look in the bottom right. There should be a highlighted area there. Double click it.
12. jmp it.

SITE PATCH:
1. Search roblox.com
2. Replace all of the roblox.com links shown. (using the same method as for the Public Key)
3. Control + E to replace!
(There is a check for how long the site name is, try to shoot for a 10 character name)
4!!! READ ME!!!: Do appdata.xml AFTER you do site patch. dont do it before you patch! Or i wil kill you!

IN THE CASE YOUR SITE IS OVER 10 CHARACTERS:

Find the hex length of your site. For example, roblox.com is A, so if my site was roblox2.xyz, it'd be B
Above most of the roblox.com things in the list, is a push then the site length. Change it to the length of your site.

USING EXTREMELY LONG SITES:

If your site is over 12 characters, it might be too long for normal methods to be used. You'll have to do some extra steps.

1. Scroll down to the bottom of the dump, there should be plenty of free space down there.
2. Type your site in. EXAMPLE: thissiteissocool.cf
3. Right click on the first character (in my example its t) and copy the address.
4. Go to the roblox.com, and double click it (not the comment, the push 0x?????)
5. Change push 0x?????? to whatever address is in your clipboard.

there is no joinscripturl for early 2012 and below, you can use
PLAYER.exe -script "dofile('http://yoursite.local/path/to/your/join.php?ip=127.0.0.1')" "C:\PATH\TO\MAP.rbxl" 

the example "C:\PATH\TO\MAP.rbxl" is not really needed for joining, only when hosting.
