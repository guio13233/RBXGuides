These guides will tell you how to patch almost every version of roblox prior to 2015.

TOOLS TO USE:
x32dbg (Make sure its x32dbg, not x64dbg)
RBXSigTools (2011+)
your brain

-----------------------------------------------------------

Here is the key terms so I dont have to rewrite some guides, and for you (my dear reader)'s experience.

Key Terms:

String Search - Using the string search tool inside of x32dbg. It only has to be done once, and
Is usually done by going to symbols, RobloxApp (or whatever your exe is called), double clicking it,
then pressing the small "aZ" symbol in the top right of your x32dbg window.

EXAMPLE: String Search trust check

-----------------------------------------------------------

jmp - Change a jne or a je to jmp. It just saves words

EXAMPLE: jmp the jne above "trust check failed for %s"

-----------------------------------------------------------

Patch - Pressing the bandaid icon in the top left, or pressing Control + P [ OR ] The process of modifying a Roblox client.

EXAMPLE 1: Patch the client, THEN change appdata.xml
EXAMPLE 2: Remember to patch, never use a vanilla client.
